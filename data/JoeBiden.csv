1308195555940749316,"When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection. It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us. You deserve a president who will put you first."

1305260678991810562,"With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger. The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women. But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable."

1303839351671980032,You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
1303826768525131776,"If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin. It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty."
1303807139203493888,"Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him. I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21."

1295359475453440000,The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
1295152109143433216,"As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences. She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House."

1294297729678495744,"Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it."

1293215600680951810,"Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless. I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need."
1293175334037262336,"I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control. I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward. We'll get it done, together."
1293012127708516353,"This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping. I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy."

1292928711243771911,Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.
1292924430272921606,"Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security. We can't let that happen."
1292888443261919232,"President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable. I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans."
1292870827168342017,"Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:"

1292256781826052097,"Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security. Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt."
1292249233316130816,"Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world."

1291869982196809728,"I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone."
1291837770080583688,It didn't have to be this bad.
1291816882434121728,"Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans. It's time we pick a different path."
1291784921841688578,Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control.
1291762273023737858,"While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job."
1291690890566737920,The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.
1291690889874743296,"Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model: - An infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19 - More than 183,000 cases - Lengthy delays in test results"
1291690889174228992,Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing. He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it. He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
1291690888477970432,President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
1291540508796428290,"My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future."
1291540508091854849,"Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place."
1291540507416559617,"Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all."
1291528230395162629,"I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to: - Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act - Enact automatic and same-day voter registration - Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts"
1291513130745561088,John Lewis left us with marching orders. It’s up to all of us to carry them out:
1291495515180285952,"Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can."
1291470348928475136,Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
1291445184635387904,"The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law."
1291419262788263938,"55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote."
1291409699393482753,The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used.

1291172134341840896,"Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19. I’ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better."
1291158292786544643,"Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House."
1291146968136323073,"Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know."

1291090345103679494,"Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again."
1291075245751832576,"Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence."
1291042027212140546,"I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected."
1290998489975885826,"The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it."
1290812262744305665,"From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership."
1290792130345082880,"On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue."
1290779547072253955,"Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast."

1290675360682500096,"The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community:"
1290670187482624006,"As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic."

1257021761872449542,A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world.

1243670382902759424,"In response to the economic impact of COVID-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt."
1243632793927577600,Join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. Tune in now:
1243621727642542081,"This afternoon, I’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us:"
1243594531611828226,"Patients need ventilators. Nurses need equipment. And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it. I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t."
1243575004702208000,"The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is. He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak. It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
1243533113625542657,"It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready. Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price."
1243349519179317249,"The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to: - Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine"
1243339452530843648,"The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American."
1243329134341783564,"President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered."
1243316048255791106,"Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you."
1243303345076535308,The Trump Administration misled the American people.
1243286275274178560,"We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street. It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast. If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen."
1243266475965775881,"If I were President, here's what I would do right now: - Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic - Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it - Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal"
1243255073817460741,"Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel."
1243233756183494661,"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day."
1243208171419774976,"Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together."
1243182920912822272,"The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work:"
1242979580941492226,"""If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June."" Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives."
1242967501442412544,"In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats. Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most."
1242942917229948928,"Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks:"
1242940651542626304,We will not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities they have been working to build.
1242910626738913282,Dr. Fauci should be on TV a lot more than President Trump.
1242891248983105536,"Alright, folks. We're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited. Join us at 6:30 PM ET at"
1242860175444168705,I'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in to watch live:
1242854748551819264,"The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done."
1242814745423384578,The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
1242604610319192065,"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
1242594795723173894,"President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price."
1242564346074607619,"As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now."
1242545627768197123,President Trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on Twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need.
1242534145865089027,Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.
1242521059850510341,The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
1242502232370749443,It has been a month since this tweet.
1242461164975591429,"I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
1242266351084998656,"As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions. No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives."
1242240964288286721,"In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.” In February, he said it would disappear. Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.” Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price."
1242227794089779201,"Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need. We will overcome this, together."
1242209758603403264,"Where are the tests? Where are the masks? Where are the ventilators? The American people deserve answers, Mr. President."
1242176036390842368,"Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need."
1242166298714476550,A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs. It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first.
1242141560193630211,"During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care."
1242128161657229313,What is President Trump waiting for? Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe. Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe. He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it.
1242100712890195968,I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live:
1242091730872107013,"President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check."
1241904225396891649,"It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check."
1241884112778035200,President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.
1241869420944863232,"In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right."
1241869419988619265,"We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now."
1241869418981920769,"Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again."
1241843344034103301,"On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.” That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace. We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period."
1241813347206672384,"No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs."
1241813346174844929,"No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks."
1241813344610328576,It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.
1241800059186040835,"We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing."
1241772947066544135,"Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go."
1241745449209352193,"In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people. Donald Trump is incapable of doing that."
1241492280709537793,"We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job."
1241471645233053699,Donald Trump has failed the American people.
1241416531684331526,"Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us:"
1241406213864280064,"The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free. The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free. Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too. We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs."
1241387087989026822,"From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise."
1241170839254568960,The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
1241170838478520321,"Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns."
1241170837568438273,"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus."
1241147005658755072,"If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together."
1241122660148490252,The President says no one cares about being tested. Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?
1241104438846259201,"Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics & terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most."
1241077046022787074,The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace.
1241027971760025603,"The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections."
1240998490383224832,"Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices."
1240998489498288129,"I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees."
1240808170651619329,".@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support."
1240798575468175364,"The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis."
1240778927431352325,This administration is truly morally bankrupt.
1240761659888672769,Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same.
1240711637218123777,My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis.
1240690266358480896,"Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?"
1240690264357793792,"Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words."
1240675649968168960,.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
1240670113713528833,"This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another. When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together."
1240646710021537792,The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19. Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
1240447899621658624,Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November.
1240436952538775553,"I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth."
1240423237126737920,It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
1240408892166660096,"We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief."
1240378693379293195,I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
1240361258957897728,Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.
1240343464405086209,"Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction."
1240318546896228353,"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are. We can and will meet this challenge — together."
1240280546699366401,"The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics. We need a leader who will be ready on day one."
1240106902274494466,"Thank you to everyone in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois who supported our campaign. From day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation — and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. Let’s do this, together."
1240089565743874048,I'm about to address tonight's election results from Delaware. Tune in to watch live:
1240040212903968770,This moment demands that we choose: Hope over fear Unity over division Truth over lies Science over fiction
1240004225641394177,This crisis requires a decisive economic response. We need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.
1239988874807586816,"Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. Learn more:"
1239940807966085122,"My mom always said, ""Being Irish is about faith, family, and courage."" Today, we celebrate the strong role Irish-Americans have played in our communities, the strength of the U.S.-Ireland relationship, and the ongoing values shared by our two nations. Happy St. Patrick's Day!"
1239932555333373960,"Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news. We need a president who will do their job and lead this country."
1239729414809608193,"Coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. Please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. We will get through this — together."
1239694182697992192,"If I win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. If I win the presidency and have the opportunity, I will name the first black woman ever to the Supreme Court. A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for."
1239669017327087622,"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has: - Fanned the flames of hate - Embraced white supremacists - Separated families at the border - Threatened our democracy We have to get him out of the White House."
1239653917740466179,The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis.
1239631268209479682,"In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people — not more handouts for giant corporations."
1239618931058511875,"Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits."
1239559042214825991,We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.
1239411048232505347,"I know times are tough — but we’re going to get through this. We’ve got four big primaries coming up on Tuesday, and our campaign could really use your help. Chip in what you can — I really appreciate it:"
1239374325041463296,$90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again. I did that. Bernie watched. #DemDebate
1239371922204483584,"We're building the campaign that will win this nomination and defeat Donald Trump. If you're with us, please chip in what you can right now to keep the momentum going from tonight's #DemDebate:"
1239370040404828160,"The coronavirus pandemic is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #DemDebate"
1239367915171971072,"We need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. My plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief."

1239364431294926848,"We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will: - End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations - Ban new drilling on federal lands & waters - Hold oil executives accountable - Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement"
1239364065413267456,"No se puede negar la amenaza existencial del cambio climático, y se está acabando el tiempo para abordarlo. Tenemos que tomar medidas sin precedentes aquí en nuestro país y unir al mundo para hacer frente a esta crisis. Lea el plan completo:"
1239363997817868290,There is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. We have to take unprecedented action here at home and rally the world to tackle this crisis head on. Read the full plan:
1239360027372204033,Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it. Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate
1239358461999222784,My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
1239356795463794688,"If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate"
1239356529612132353,"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times. We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."
1239354904004698112,I took on Paul Ryan's cuts to Medicare and Social Security — to his face. #DemDebate

1239353172835082240,Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees. We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate
1239352291448233984,"All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate"
